    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      My educational journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in IT. I hold
      an Associate of Science in Computer Science from Tulsa Community College and
      am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from
      Western Governors University. Additionally, I am a CompTIA A+ certified
      professional, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining a high standard of
      technical proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about technology and its impact on society. I have a keen
      interest in exploring the world of technology and how it has impacted our
      lives. I am always looking for new ways to utilize technology to solve
      real-world problems.

    <p>
    In my recent role as an IT Support Specialist 1 with the Choctaw Nation, I honed
    my skills in troubleshooting hardware and software issues, managing user
    accounts in Active Directory and Azure, and ensuring network security. My
    previous experience as an IT Technician at Fancy Dance Casino further developed
    my ability to perform remote troubleshooting, update software, and train
    employees on cybersecurity best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my technical skills, I bring a strong sense of responsibility and
      dedication to every role I undertake. As a father of three, I have developed
      excellent time management and multitasking abilities. My strong faith and
      commitment to lifelong learning drive me to continuously seek improvement and
      growth, both personally and professionally. I am also a supportive spouse,
      which has taught me the importance of collaboration and effective
      communication.
